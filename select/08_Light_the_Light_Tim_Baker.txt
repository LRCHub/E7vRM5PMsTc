Happiness to all my friends and to all I haven't met
It's not the Christmas that we dreamt, but then it isn't over yet
Yeah all my records and my decorations, they're second hand at best
And all of the presents that I wanted to get you, well there wasn't much to wrap

But I ain't just talking, I don't care what you bought
All i want, you know I already got
To watch you watching all the light coming on

On all of the good in you, I see it pushing through
That's what I'm drinking to: seeing the good everywhere that I look
Yeah seeing the good everywhere that I look

What does it mean, do I even believe, and why'd I try to get you these things?
That I do, I think it's just so you at least believe in me
Cause sometimes, in the long dark nights, it's hard to see the brighter side
But I won't lie, I only light the light just to see it in your eyes

They're open wide, and I know what you're thinking
If only life could be all like this weekend
You'd wanna try it if you saw you like I did, oh i could see it

All of the good in you, I seen it pushing through
That's what I'm drinking to: seeing the good everywhere that I look
Yeah seeing the good everywhere that I look

Happiness to all my friends and to all I haven't met
It's not the Christmas that we dreamt, but still it isn't over yet
When we arrive they'll be spilling their wine, they'll be swinging the side door in
And our empty hands are just open hands and that's the only way to feel it

Yeah all of the good in you, I see it pushing through
That's what i'm drinking to: seeing the good everywhere that I look
Oh all of the good in you, I see it pushing through
And that's what i'm drinking to: seeing the good everywhere that I look
Pushing the shadows from the edge of the room
Trying for one night just to live like I should
Seeing the good everywhere that I look
